        "When the underlying win probabilities are unknown, we use an A/B testing policy: first play each arm equally for a fixed number of test runs, then exploit the empirically best arm for the remaining attempts. With 10 000 total plays, increasing the number of test runs per arm improves decision reliability but reduces the time left for exploitation. The total returns (mean ± std) for test budgets of 10–3000 per arm show that small test sizes produce high variance and sometimes incorrect choices, while extremely large test budgets waste plays on exploration. **The optimal balance occurs around 100–300 test runs per arm**, where the average cumulative reward is highest (~5800–5900). At that point, the strategy consistently identifies the best-performing bandit (usually A) and achieves near-maximum total reward."

Simulations with 10 000 total plays show that small ε values (0.01–0.05) lead to premature exploitation and sub-optimal rewards, while very large ε values (≥ 0.3) over-explore and waste attempts. **The optimal trade-off occurs around ε = 0.1**, yielding the highest mean cumulative reward (≈ 5900) with moderate dispersion. After a few hundred plays, the policy consistently converges to the best bandit (A), indicating sufficient exploration to identify the most rewarding option."

        "The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm selects arms by combining estimated mean rewards with a confidence term proportional to $(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta \\ln t}{n_i}})$. Increasing β encourages more exploration. Simulations with 10 000 total plays show that moderate **β values (0.5–1.0) yield the highest mean cumulative reward (~5900)** with relatively low dispersion. For larger β values (≥ 4), excessive exploration reduces overall performance. Thus, UCB efficiently learns the optimal arm and achieves strong performance even with limited parameter tuning. The best-performing bandit (A) becomes evident within the early phase of play as the uncertainty in estimates diminishes."
